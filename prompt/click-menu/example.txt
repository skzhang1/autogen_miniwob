The task is for the agent to select Leonelle > Jane > Amabel from the HTML code provided.
Here is a plan to solve this example task on the webpage with the autonomous agent. You must use "movemouse" not "clickxpath" to expand option.
1. movemouse //*[text()="Leonelle"]
2. movemouse //*[text()="Jane"]
3. clickxpath //*[text()="Amabel"]
